In exponential families with canonical parameterization the effect is to penalize the likelihood by the Jeffreys invariant prior. In binomial logistic models, Poisson log linear models and certain other generalized linear models, the Jeffreys prior penalty function can be imposed in standard regression software using a scheme of iterative adjustments to the data.},

Estimation is implemented using a modified version of the iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm that allows for fast estimation in the presence of HDFE. Because the code is built around the reghdfe package, it has similar syntax, supports many of the same functionalities, and benefits from reghdfe's fast convergence properties for computing high-dimensional least squares problems. Performance is further enhanced by some new techniques we introduce for accelerating HDFE-IRLS estimation specifically. ppmlhdfe also implements a novel and more robust approach to check for the existence of (pseudo) maximum likelihood estimates.},

The kendallknight package, following Knight (1966) and posterior literature, reduces the time complexity resulting in drastic reductions in computation time, transforming operations that would take minutes or hours into milliseconds or minutes, while maintaining precision and correctly handling edge cases and errors. The package is particularly advantageous in econometric and statistical contexts where rapid and accurate calculation of Kendall’s correlation coefficient is desirable. Benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance gains over the Base R implementation, especially for large datasets.},

We explain why this problem arises and propose an appropriate estimator. Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated. We develop the argument using one particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade. We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.},

The approach, unlike other fast methods for solving such problems, provides a covariance matrix for the remaining coefficients. The article also sets out a method for solving the resulting sparse system, and the new scheme is shown, by some examples, to be comparable in computational efficiency to other fast methods. The method is also useful for transforming away groups of pure control dummies. A parallelized implementation of the proposed method has been made available as an R-package lfe on CRAN.},
