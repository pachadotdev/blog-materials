Estimation is implemented using a modified version of the iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) algorithm that allows for fast estimation in the presence of HDFE. Because the code is built around the reghdfe package, it has similar syntax, supports many of the same functionalities, and benefits from reghdfe's fast convergence properties for computing high-dimensional least squares problems. Performance is further enhanced by some new techniques we introduce for accelerating HDFE-IRLS estimation specifically. ppmlhdfe also implements a novel and more robust approach to check for the existence of (pseudo) maximum likelihood estimates.},

The package is particularly advantageous in econometric and statistical contexts where rapid and accurate calculation of Kendall’s correlation coefficient is desirable.

Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated.
